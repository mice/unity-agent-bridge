# AGBM_311

## Requirement
SCHED-G01–G05 as applicable; add-editor-task-scheduling. Preserve actual execution ownership, immutable origins and bounded non-replaying recovery.

## Risk
Logical completion, missing persistence or transport projection could incorrectly authorize conflicting execution or lose a queued request's original identity.

## Steps and Assertions
Advance the fake clock to the exact original deadline. Expiry records timeout without a start token; the next valid request can proceed.

## Evidence
Product .NET foundation tests exercise the actual scheduling/lifecycle/store/codec sources through fake clocks and record fixtures. These are not Unity integration results. Raw TRX and source identity are recorded in the workbench scheduling acceptance evidence; Poller/service integration and real fixed A/B acceptance remain separate gates.
